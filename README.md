# ReneWind_Project: Project Overview
* Created a tool that to measure and predict degradation and future component capability (Recall 0.85 on test data) using ciphered datasets
* Optimized Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, AdaBoost, Gradient Boost, XGBoost, Bagging Classifiers using Under/Oversampling, GridSearch CV and Hyperparameter tuning to reach the best model
